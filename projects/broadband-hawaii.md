Modern society is reliant on technology for everyday tasks, and not everyone can access online services. The COVID-19 pandemic magnified this **digital divide** as remote work and schooling was challenging for individuals lacking basic information technology skills.

Broadband for Hawaii was created as a solution to this problem. Broadband for Hawaii is an interactive, accessible online platform that encourages people to learn more about the internet and technology through classes and workshops. 

This application is catered towards people of all backgrounds from students K-12, parents, and family members, to the general public and community members who may be unfamiliar with connecting to and using the internet.
